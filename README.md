# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website project built as part of The Odin Project(RECIPE PROJECT).  
The goal of the project is to practice working with **basic HTML structure, linking between pages, and applying external CSS styling**.

## Project Overview
- A main homepage (`index.html`) that links to different recipe pages.
- Each recipe page (`lasagna.html`, `pancakes.html`, `beef-stew.html`, `ChocolateCookies.html`, etc.) includes:
  - A heading with the recipe name
  - An image of the dish
  - A short description
  - An ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - A link back to the homepage for easy navigation
- A single external stylesheet (`style.css`) is used for consistent styling across all pages.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I practiced:
- Structuring HTML pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
- Organizing files and directories for a small website.
- Using relative paths (`../`) to correctly link files between folders.
- Linking an external CSS stylesheet and applying styling rules.
- Writing semantic and clean HTML code.

## Reflection
While working on this project, I learned the importance of **keeping files organized** and how to properly use **relative paths** when linking CSS or other files.  
At first, I had issues with my stylesheet not applying, but I realized the problem was the **path in the `<link>` tag**, and I fixed it by referencing the correct file location.  

I also practiced separating CSS into an external file (`style.css`), which makes the project more **readable and maintainable**.  
Overall, this project helped me build a stronger foundation in **HTML structure and CSS basics**, and I now feel more confident about setting up and styling small websites.
