    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic beef stew is the epitome of comfort food. Chunks of tender beef, carrots, and potatoes are simmered in a rich, flavorful broth until everything is fall-apart delicious. It's the perfect one-pot meal for a cold evening.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>3 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>3 potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss the beef cubes with flour, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in batches and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onion to the pot and cook until soft. Add garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red wine (if using) and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Stir in beef broth, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pot. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat, cover, and cook for 1.5 hours.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. Cook for another 30-40 minutes, or until the vegetables and beef are tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaf before serving. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
